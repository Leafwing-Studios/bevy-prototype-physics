# Goals

- Kinematics
	- Linear motion: position, velocity, acceleration
	- Angular motion: angular position, angular velocity, angular acceleration
	- Alternative solvers
- Force and torque
	- Mass and force primitives
	- Sensible API for constant and non-constant forces
		- "Apply force `f` for time period `[t0, t1]`"
	- Drag
- Rigid body
	- Collisions
		- Detection
		- Constraint force resolution
			- Statics
		- Continuous detection
- Friction
	- Static vs. Dynamic
- Ratchets for simple cases
  - Pure "set velocity" case
  - Psuedo "set velocity" that still does slight acceleration and deceleration
- Common physics gizmos
	- Springs
	- Joints (these are just constraints)
